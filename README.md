Party Parrot is a lighting-designer robot companion for DJs.

It listens on your computer's microphone, then coordinates any number of DMX fixtures. It currently supports:
 - Moving lights
 - Moving led bars
 - LED Pars
 - Lasers

It's basic operation is to coordinate colors across fixtures, then have them listen to the level of audio energy on different frequency bands. The higher the energy, the more energetic the lights get (e.g. from dull pulses up to strobes).
