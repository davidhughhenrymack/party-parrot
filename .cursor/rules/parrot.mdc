Party Parrot is a system that listens to the microphone in realtime, and processes it to make DMX lighting and visuals that respond to dance music.

## Project structure
Use poetry to manage dependencies and to launch commands with `poetry run ...`

Launch tests with `just test`
Launch main app with `just launch`
Add major new features to the `Justfile`

## Typing
We use beartype to enforce types.
Decorate classes and lone methods with @beartype. Use unit tests to provide simple testing of this typing.

## Testing
Write tests in pytest. Tests should be succint and maintainable. Avoid test sprawl.
New code should have at least some simple useful tests
